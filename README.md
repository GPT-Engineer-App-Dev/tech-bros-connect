# tech-bros-connect

Create a landing page for a dating app aimed at tech bros. The page should have:

- A bold, modern design with tech-inspired imagery 
- A catchy headline about finding love in the tech world
- A few key benefits of the app, like matching based on favorite programming languages
- A prominent call-to-action to download the app
- Placeholder screenshots of the app interface

Use a tongue-in-cheek, playful tone that appeals to tech bros. The actual app name and screenshots aren't needed yet, just use something generic like "TechMate".
